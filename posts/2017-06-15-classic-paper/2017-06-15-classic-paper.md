Google announced today that my paper *An interior algorithm for nonlinear optimization that combines line search and trust region steps* is among [the top cited papers published in 2006 in optimization](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&citsig=AAGBfm1OdPE6Bb-5Fl3GPJgr57sNJjIHrA&view_op=list_classic_articles&by=2006&vq=mathematicaloptimization&user=OCFgRysAAAAJ#uOCFgRysAAAAJ).

The paper appeared in [Mathematical Programming](https://link.springer.com/journal/10107) and concerns extensions of the frighteningly effective KNITRO solver, now known as [Artely KNITRO](https://www.artelys.com/en/optimization-tools/knitro).

KNITRO's main competitor in the continuous optimization arena is arguably the highly-successful open-source solver [IPOPT](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt) by Andreas WÃ¤chter.
IPOPT tops the list of most-cited papers in optimization in 2006, according to Google's ranking.

Andreas is now faculty at Northwestern University, where I held a post-doctoral appointment at the time I co-authored the KNITRO paper.

As it happens, I currently share an office with Charles Audet, who also authors one of the most-cited papers that year.

At the time of this writing, Google only published the most-cited papers for 2006.
Presumably, other years will follow.
