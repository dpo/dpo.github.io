# [Linear Systems from Interior Methods](https://github.com/optimizers/ip-systems)

A flexible collection of linear systems arising from interior-point methods for quadratic optimization in [MatrixMarket](http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html#MMformat) format.
The systems are supplied in the form of their blocks, which can be rearranged, along with accompanying right-hand sides.
