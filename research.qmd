My scientific interests span computational optimization, numerical analysis, numerical linear algebra, scientific computing, and modeling environments. I have a keen interest in the interplay between computational science and programming languages.

My research focuses on the design, convergence analysis, numerical properties, practical implementation, and testing of algorithms for continuous optimization and their linear algebra kernels. I am equally interested in applying algorithms that I design to problems that arise in engineering and science.

My research activities thus comprise tightly interconnected theoretical analyses of computational methods and high-quality implementations to aid in the modeling and solution of practical problems.
